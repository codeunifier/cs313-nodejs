# cs313-nodejs

This project is for the CS313 Web Engineering II course at Brigham Young University - Idaho.<br>

The application is a single-page chat service intended for use within the <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> community. The 
application will make it easy for users to send images / links to cards they want to share with others, and will include other tools
to allow for communication about the game to be done quickly and effectively.

I have often found that, in talking to my friends about the game, if I wanted to show someone else a card I found online, I would have to 
send them a screenshot, a link, or just the name of the card for them to look up. This chat service is intended to make it easier to
share cards and other information by embedding images and links to the cards within the chat window itself.

This application will be utilizing a full MEAN stack in development, and will be deployed to Heroku.
